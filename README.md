## Introduction
Introduction
We'll be looking at data about teams in National Football League (NFL). For those of you living under a rock:

The NFL is a professional American football league that consists of 32 teams, divided equally between the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference. The goal of each team is to win as many games out of a 17 game season as possible. Teams win games by scoring more points than their opponents. This can be done in one of five ways:

- Touchdown (six points)
- Field Goal (three points)
- Two-Point Conversion (two points)
- Extra Point (one point)
- Safety (two points)

In principle, better players generally cost more, so teams that want good players need to spend more money. Teams that spend the most, theoretically, should win the most.

Instead of focusing on what would make an amazing team, lets focus on the players. We will be taking a look at the players in the NFL (from the Madden NFL 21 video game) compare to eachother and to the top 200 players. We will also look at what attributes they possess, and how those attributes contribute to their overall player rating (a measure of hey impactful a player is).
